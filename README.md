# Hype

<h1> Hype

Author: Oliver Jan

<b>Purpose</b>: This hype project focuses on the intersections of my interests in data science, machine learning, and sneakers. As I am still on the project-based learning path, I thought this would be a fairly unique and interesting personal project to pursue to study the hyped sneaker trends over time. 

In other words, did Kanye really jump over the jumpman? Or is <i>New Balance</i> on the rise (that's my prediction, at least)?

<h2><b>Learning Objectives:
<li>Get more practice with scraping data via an API
<li>Learn how to build a convolutional neural network via TensorFlow
<li>Understanding and utilizing proper data structures to hold image data
<li>Practice times-series analyses and learn a bunch from tackling this notorious area
<li>To be continued...

<h2>Goals:

1. Connect my scraper utility to access Reddit via their public API, <b>praw</b>

2. Collect raw data from my most frequented subreddit ("reddit.com/r/sneakers")

3. Train a multi-class, convolutional neural network with existing, labeled data, that I either label myself or get from an existing repository

4. Feed the reddit data into the CNN to get "Nike", "Adidas", "New_Balance", etc. to generate further labeled data that can then be used for analysis

5. Using this labeled data, perform EDA to understand trends over time (could consider using FB Prophet for times-series analysis)

6. To be determined...
