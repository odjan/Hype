## Hype

### Author: Oliver Jan

This hype project bridges my interests in data science, machine learning, and sneakers. As I am still on the project-based learning path, I thought this would be a fairly unique and interesting personal project to pursue to study the hyped sneaker trends over time. 

### Learning Objectives

* Get more practice with scraping data via an API
* Learn how to build a convolutional neural network via TensorFlow
* Understanding and utilizing proper data structures to hold image data
* Practice times-series analyses and learn a bunch from tackling this notorious area
* To be continued...

### Goals

* Connect my scraper utility to access Reddit via their public API, 'praw'
* Collect raw data from my most frequented subreddit ("reddit.com/r/sneakers")
* Train a multi-class, convolutional neural network with existing, labeled data, that I either label myself or get from an existing repository
* Feed the scraped, reddit data into the CNN to get "Nike", "Adidas", "New_Balance", etc. to generate further labeled data that can then be used for analysis
* Using this labeled data, perform EDA to understand trends over time (could consider using FB Prophet for times-series analysis)
* To be determined...
